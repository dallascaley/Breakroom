General notes: I am trying to set up a secure SSL certificate for my website which is currently
hosted only locally.  Because ChatGPT is asking me to close the browser often I am writing down
all my notes here so that I can get ChatGPT back into context quickly.  Here is a log of all my
notes

Day 1:

I have a website which uses the following:

Docker and Docker Desktop in a Windows 11 environment
docker-compose with three containers
  nginx reverse proxy
  express.js front end
  vue.js back end

the site is supposed to be at https://local.prosaurus.com

I have set up the hosts file to point local.prosaurus.com to 127.0.0.1

I have created an encryption certificate and placed it into the correct location in the host machine, 
I have also verified that these certificate files actually exist in the reverse proxy container.

Note, the encryption certificate that i generated was created using openssl not letsencrypt, However
I have placed them into a folder where I had previously placed letsencrypt certs. (this might be an issue?)

I have verified that the permissions are correct on both the key and cert file 644 and 600 respectively

I have verified that the user who runs nginx (which is the user called 'nginx') has ownership of the cert files

I have used openssl to verify that the certificate and key pair match

I have added the certificate using certmgr to the host machine

I have rebooted the machine (and restarted the browser)

after all of this the site still shows not secure.

Day 2:

Note, In the past, I had this working however this was when my site was setup in a ubuntu VM under windows, it 
is not set up that way anymore, it is now directly in my windows machine in docker.  When i set it up originally
I set it up using letsencrypt which required messing around with DNS entries.  I am again thinking this is the 
better option.  Since that time however I have changed the url to https://local.prosaurus.com and i have added
a host file entry so that the system will know to look at 127.0.0.1 to find the site.  If i were to go back to
my original method, would i need to remove that host file?

Day 3:

On day 2, ChatGPT gave me the impression that I was doing something wrong with my self signed certificate.  What 
I had been doing was that I had added the certificate using the certmgr tool in Windows, however since the website
was actually being served from Docker (specifically the reverse proxy container of my three container cluster) it 
seemed necessary to add the cert there as well (or in stead of the windows one).  I tried to do that by adding the
following to my docker-compose file:

   command: >
      /bin/sh -c "apk update && apk add --no-cache ca-certificates && cp /etc/letsencrypt/live/prosaurus.com/local.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/ && update-ca-certificates && nginx -g 'daemon off;'"

and also by removing any references to https in the backend container since it was behind the proxy and not https.

in doing this, the entire site broke and it took the rest of the day to get it back up.  I now have it up again however
I had to remove the command mentioned above in docker-compose.  I suspect that is stil important?  the site still
does not work with the cert.

Note, I promped Claude.ai with this same message, I am now going based on Claude's recommentations...

Try to create a new key and ensure it has the exact common name:

$ openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout local.prosaurus.com.key -out local.prosaurus.com.crt -days 365 -nodes -subj "/CN=local.prosaurus.com"

added this to docker-compose:

command: >
      /bin/sh -c "
        apk update && 
        apk add --no-cache ca-certificates && 
        cp /etc/letsencrypt/live/local.prosaurus.com/local.prosaurus.com.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/ && 
        update-ca-certificates && 
        nginx -g 'daemon off;'
      "

note, i changed the file path to actually work

changed default server config like so:

  ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/local.prosaurus.com/local.prosaurus.com.crt;
  ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/local.prosaurus.com/local.prosaurus.com.key;

did this:

Add certificate to Windows (correctly)

Double-click the local.prosaurus.com.crt file
Click "Install Certificate"
Choose "Local Machine" (not Current User)
Select "Place all certificates in the following store"
Click "Browse" and select "Trusted Root Certification Authorities"
Complete the installation

and this...

Close all browser windows completely
Clear SSL state in Windows: certmgr.msc → Personal → Certificates → delete any old certificates
Restart browser
Try accessing https://local.prosaurus.com

and it worked!
