1) Obvious stuff

   A) get that dumb email validation thing working correctly, it's still broken

   B) Does it make sense to add unit/functional tests?

   C) Same question for load testing

2) What is sellable?

   A) There is no network yet, and there won't be a decent sized network for quite a while

     Also

   B) It costs money to run this thing.  In reality if we got enough users to say we had a real
      network, it would cost too much money for us to operate it.

     And

   C) I don't want venture capital funding, because that would mean we are beholden to their
      interests and would likely lead to advertising, which is something we want to avoid

     Therefore:

   D) The site needs to have features that would be valuable for an individual user.  In my mind
      the most obvious thing that would be valuable for an individual user would be:

      A blog: one that is really good/really easy to use, relatively cheap

	      The concept of owning your own content.  posting long messages (in a blog or otherwise) and
	      then being able to reference this on other sites like Facebook or whatever could be valuable

      An art gallery: Many wordpress sites have galleries for art.

	      The ability to sell stuff from your art gallery?

	      usage statistics from your blog

	      the ability to export your entire blog to your own site to cut down on costs and also maintain
	      complete ownership of your work.

      A store: 

      	  just straight up sell stuff

      	  Inventory

      	  Customer service

      A musician/band page

          Expose people to your music

          sell stuff (CDs, T-shirts, whatnot)

          Share practice recordings

      Small company communications platform

          ticket management
