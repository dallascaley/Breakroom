Here is the plan... I have one repo which has a Dockerized app (front-end, back-end and reverse proxy).   This app is setup with production and local docker-compose files that both work (locally).  I have another repo which contains a Terraform configuration which I was trying to use to deploy the production version of the Dockerized app to AWS.  This has been problematic.   So, someone convinced me that I should use Ansible for configuration management.  This would mean (i'm guessing) to take the bulk of what I currently have in my main.tf user_data section and doing that in the new Ansible code (which is in a third repo btw).   I need help making this transition

Great ‚Äî you've got a solid starting point, and you're absolutely right that you're now crossing into a multi-repo infrastructure deployment model. Let's break this down into a clean migration strategy, and I‚Äôll help you untangle the pieces and guide you step-by-step.

üß† Summary of What You Have

  Repo 1: Dockerized App Repo

    * Has:

      * Frontend, backend, reverse proxy
      * docker-compose.yml (both local and prod)

    * Status:

      * Runs well locally
      * Production setup works with correct compose config

  Repo 2: Terraform Repo

    * Goal: Deploy app infrastructure (probably EC2, VPC, etc.)
    * Problem: Using user_data in main.tf to provision instances and run Docker there is becoming messy

  Repo 3: Ansible Repo (New)

    * Goal: Replace user_data provisioning with Ansible-based configuration
    * Status: Starting point ‚Äî unclear what's already there

‚úÖ Goal

  * Use Terraform for infrastructure provisioning (VPC, EC2, Security Groups, etc.)
  * Use Ansible for configuration management (installing Docker, copying your app repo to EC2, running docker-compose)
  * Keep app logic (Dockerfiles, compose files) in Repo 1

üîÅ Transition Strategy (Terraform + Ansible)

  Step 1: Clean Up Terraform

    Terraform should:

      * Create EC2 instances (probably with Amazon Linux 2 or Ubuntu)
      * Create security groups, key pairs, etc.
      * Tag EC2s appropriately so Ansible can find them
      * Avoid most user_data logic, except maybe a bootstrap script to install Python if needed (for Ansible to run)

    üß† Keep user_data minimal, e.g.:

      sudo apt update
      sudo apt install -y python3  # required for Ansible

  Step 2: Design Ansible Playbooks

    Ansible should:

      * SSH into EC2s
      * Install Docker and Docker Compose
      * Clone the app repo (Repo 1) or use copy if you prefer local files
      * Run docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d

    üîß Typical Ansible roles/tasks:

      * roles/docker/tasks/main.yml
      * roles/app/tasks/main.yml

    Example playbook:

      - hosts: app_servers
        become: yes
        roles:
          - docker
          - app

  Step 3: Setup Inventory

    Terraform can output the public IPs of EC2 instances as part of the plan output.

    Then either:

      * Manually copy IPs to an Ansible inventory.ini file
      * Or, even better: use dynamic inventory via Terraform output

      Example:

        [app_servers]
        ec2-1-2-3-4.compute.amazonaws.com ansible_user=ubuntu

  Step 4: Ansible Tasks in Detail

    Docker Role (roles/docker/tasks/main.yml)

      - name: Install Docker
        apt:
          name: docker.io
          state: present
          update_cache: yes

      - name: Install Docker Compose
        get_url:
          url: https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.24.0/docker-compose-linux-x86_64
          dest: /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
          mode: '0755'


    App Role (roles/app/tasks/main.yml)

      - name: Clone app repo
        git:
          repo: https://github.com/your-org/your-app-repo.git
          dest: /opt/your-app
          version: main

      - name: Run docker-compose
        command: docker-compose -f /opt/your-app/docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
        args:
          chdir: /opt/your-app

üì¶ Folder Structure Suggestion

  infra-terraform/
    main.tf
    outputs.tf

  ansible/
    inventories/
      production.ini
    roles/
      docker/
        tasks/main.yml
      app/
        tasks/main.yml
    site.yml

  docker-app/
    docker-compose.yml
    docker-compose.prod.yml
    Dockerfile
    ...

üöÄ Workflow

  1. Run terraform apply to provision EC2(s)
  2. Get EC2 IPs (manually or from Terraform output)
  3. Update inventory.ini in Ansible repo
  4. Run: ansible-playbook -i inventories/production.ini site.yml

üß© Bonus: Automate Terraform -> Ansible

  You can export Terraform outputs to JSON:

    terraform output -json > outputs.json

  Then use Ansible‚Äôs dynamic inventory or scripts to parse it:

    * https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/inventory_guide/intro_dynamic.html

üõ†Ô∏è Help You Need From Me

  Let me know:

    * What OS are your EC2 instances running? (Ubuntu, Amazon Linux 2, etc.)
    * Are you cloning the app repo inside EC2s, or do you want to copy built images?
    * Are you deploying single-instance or multi-node?

  I can help you write the Ansible playbooks or modify your Terraform if you paste what you have.

Would you like to start with the Ansible playbook first, or clean up the Terraform setup to work with this model?
