The following log is created because Supabase is being a little bitch and complaining about every stupid fucking thing even though I don't give a shit...

Note to self: get rid of Supabase the moment this thing becomes important.

Hello dallascaley,

What Supabases bitch-ass AI bot says about it...

Summarize the issue and suggest fixes for the following lint item: Title: RLS Disabled in Public Entity: public.permissions Schema: public Issue Details: Table public.permissions is public, but RLS has not been enabled. Description: Detects cases where row level security (RLS) has not been enabled on tables in schemas exposed to PostgREST

(rename_chat) -> "RLS: public.permissions"

Checklist — what I'll do

 - Summarize the lint finding and its risk.

 - Provide clear remediation options based on common access models.

 - Give ready-to-run SQL templates (ALTER + CREATE POLICY) following Supabase RLS best practices.

 - Recommend tests and next steps.

Summary of the issue

Issue: Table public.permissions is exposed via the public schema (accessible by PostgREST) but Row Level Security (RLS) is not enabled.
Risk: Without RLS, PostgREST (and therefore public/anonymous API roles) may be able to read or modify rows they should not have access to. This is a common vector for data leakage or unauthorized modification in Supabase projects because the public API schema is intended to be API-accessible.

Recommended fixes (pick the model that fits your app)

Choose the option that matches your intended access model. After selecting, run the provided SQL. Always test with both an authenticated and anon user.

1) Minimal safe default — allow only service and authenticated users, no public access

   - Use when records are user-owned or private.

   - SQL template:

      * Enable RLS

      * Create policies that require ownership via auth.uid() (adjust user_id column name if different)
  
  SQL:

    Enable RLS: ALTER TABLE public.permissions ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

      Policies (owner-based): CREATE POLICY "Allow select to owner" ON public.permissions FOR SELECT TO authenticated USING ((SELECT auth.uid()) = user_id); CREATE POLICY "Allow insert by owner" ON public.permissions FOR INSERT TO authenticated WITH CHECK ((SELECT auth.uid()) = user_id); CREATE POLICY "Allow update by owner" ON public.permissions FOR UPDATE TO authenticated USING ((SELECT auth.uid()) = user_id) WITH CHECK ((SELECT auth.uid()) = user_id); CREATE POLICY "Allow delete by owner" ON public.permissions FOR DELETE TO authenticated USING ((SELECT auth.uid()) = user_id);

      Recommendation: create an index on user_id: CREATE INDEX idx_permissions_user_id ON public.permissions(user_id);

      1) Public read, authenticated write — when rows are generally public but only logged-in users can create/modify

        SQL: ALTER TABLE public.permissions ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY; CREATE POLICY "Public read" ON public.permissions FOR SELECT TO anon, authenticated USING (true); CREATE POLICY "Authenticated insert" ON public.permissions FOR INSERT TO authenticated WITH CHECK ((SELECT auth.uid()) = user_id); CREATE POLICY "Authenticated update" ON public.permissions FOR UPDATE TO authenticated USING ((SELECT auth.uid()) = user_id) WITH CHECK ((SELECT auth.uid()) = user_id); CREATE POLICY "Authenticated delete" ON public.permissions FOR DELETE TO authenticated USING ((SELECT auth.uid()) = user_id);

      1) Multi-tenant or org-scoped access — when access is by tenant_id or organization membership

        - Use a claim from the JWT or a helper function (recommended pattern).

          Example using JWT claim tenant_id (replace types/cast as needed): ALTER TABLE public.permissions ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY; CREATE POLICY "Tenant read" ON public.permissions FOR SELECT TO authenticated USING (tenant_id = (auth.jwt() ->> 'tenant_id')::uuid); CREATE POLICY "Tenant insert" ON public.permissions FOR INSERT TO authenticated WITH CHECK (tenant_id = (auth.jwt() ->> 'tenant_id')::uuid); CREATE POLICY "Tenant update" ON public.permissions FOR UPDATE TO authenticated USING (tenant_id = (auth.jwt() ->> 'tenant_id')::uuid) WITH CHECK (tenant_id = (auth.jwt() ->> 'tenant_id')::uuid); CREATE POLICY "Tenant delete" ON public.permissions FOR DELETE TO authenticated USING (tenant_id = (auth.jwt() ->> 'tenant_id')::uuid);

          Recommendation: index tenant_id.

Important notes & best practices

  Always wrap auth.uid() in a SELECT as shown — this improves caching and matches Supabase guidance.

  Specify roles explicitly in the TO clause (e.g., TO authenticated, TO anon) — do not omit.

  Do not use FOR ALL — create separate policies per operation.

  Name policies with concise descriptive names in double quotes.

  Add indexes on columns used in policies (user_id, tenant_id, organization_id) to keep queries performant.

  After enabling RLS, verify behavior using:

    anon request (no JWT) to ensure anon access is what you expect.

    authenticated requests with different users/tenants to confirm isolation.

  If you need complex join-based checks, create a SECURITY DEFINER helper function in a private schema and REVOKE execute from anon/authenticated — test carefully.

Next steps I can take for you

  If you want, tell me:

    the intended access model for public.permissions (owner-based, public-read, tenant-based, role-based), and the column names used for ownership/tenant (e.g., user_id, tenant_id).

    whether you want me to generate the exact SQL tailored to your schema.

  I can then produce the final SQL and deploy it to your project (I will run the SQL if you confirm).
