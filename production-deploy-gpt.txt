I have an app, built with Docker which uses docker-compose.  I have created docker-compose.local and docker-compose.production yml files.  it also has independent prod and local .env files on both the front and back end (note this is in a three container cluster with a reverse proxy).  I have been building locally and it all works.  I now need to deploy to production.

Note, this is all in a repository for development which contains the main application code. I also have another repo which has a terraform configuration in it which i set up at the very beginning of the process but i haven't used in quite a while.  I don't remember how to use it, but i would like to do so.

Third complication.  The local app, currently uses a locally hosted Postgres database server, I will need to create a similar one in production. note i am using AWS services.   Walk me through the general steps needed

Great! You‚Äôre at a critical stage‚Äîmoving from local development to a production deployment using Docker, Docker Compose, Terraform, AWS, and a PostgreSQL database. Given your current setup and goals, here's a high-level guide broken into actionable steps. After this, I can walk through each part in depth as needed.

üó∫Ô∏è Overview of Your Setup

Dockerized App: Three services (e.g., frontend, backend, reverse proxy) in a docker-compose setup.

Environment-specific Compose & .env files: You use docker-compose.local.yml and docker-compose.production.yml, with corresponding .env files.

Two Repositories:

  App repo: Application code and docker setup.

  Infra repo: Contains Terraform configuration.

Database: Local PostgreSQL for dev; production needs RDS or EC2-hosted Postgres.

Target: AWS (EC2 or ECS likely).


‚úÖ Phase 1: Prepare the Infrastructure with Terraform

1. üîç Revisit & Understand the Terraform Repo

Clone or open your Terraform repository.

Look at:

  main.tf, variables.tf, and outputs.tf (or *.tf structure).

  See what resources it's provisioning: EC2, VPC, RDS, S3, ECS, IAM, etc.

Run:

  terraform init
  terraform plan

Tip: If there are backend state configurations (e.g. to S3), make sure the S3 bucket exists and credentials are valid.


2. üîß Modify Terraform to Include Production Postgres (if not already)

Use Amazon RDS (preferred) for managed PostgreSQL.

Sample Terraform snippet to add an RDS instance:

  resource "aws_db_instance" "production_db" {
    identifier        = "my-production-db"
    engine            = "postgres"
    instance_class    = "db.t3.micro"
    allocated_storage = 20
    name              = "mydb"
    username          = "postgres"
    password          = var.db_password
    publicly_accessible = false
    skip_final_snapshot = true
    vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.db_sg.id]
    ...
  }


3. üöÄ Apply the Terraform Configuration

Run:

  terraform apply

Store outputs (e.g., EC2 IPs, RDS endpoint) for the next steps.

‚úÖ Phase 2: Prepare the App for Production Deployment

4. üìÅ Build the Production Environment

Ensure your docker-compose.production.yml uses correct .env.production values.

  Point backend to the RDS endpoint (POSTGRES_HOST=your-rds-endpoint)

  Secure credentials via AWS Secrets Manager or .env.production (careful with secrets in version control).

Use volume mounts or copy for production .env files.


5. üõ†Ô∏è Set Up Remote Host (e.g., EC2 Instance)

Use Terraform (or manual for now) to create an EC2 instance.

SSH into EC2:

  ssh -i your-key.pem ec2-user@your-ec2-ip

Install Docker & Docker Compose:

  sudo yum update -y
  sudo yum install docker -y
  sudo systemctl start docker
  sudo usermod -aG docker ec2-user
  docker --version

Install Docker Compose:

  sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/latest/download/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
  sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose


6. üì¶ Deploy the Application

Clone your application repo onto the EC2 instance.

Provide production .env files and docker-compose.production.yml.

Start the containers:

  docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml up -d


7. üåê Configure Domain, SSL, Reverse Proxy

If you're using nginx as a reverse proxy:

  Make sure nginx container uses Let's Encrypt for SSL (e.g., via nginx-proxy + Let's Encrypt companion).

  If using a domain (e.g. example.com), point DNS to your EC2 instance‚Äôs IP.


8. üîê Secure Your Deployment

  Use AWS Security Groups to restrict access (e.g., only open ports 80/443).

  Configure SSL for HTTPS.

  Remove SSH access after deployment or restrict by IP.

  Use IAM roles or AWS Secrets Manager for sensitive info like DB credentials.


‚úÖ Phase 3: Clean Up and Automate

Add a deployment script (deploy.sh) for EC2 setup & docker-compose execution.

Consider using CI/CD (e.g., GitHub Actions) to auto-deploy to EC2.

Move away from storing secrets in .env files (use AWS SSM or Secrets Manager).


üöÄ Bonus: ECS/Fargate for Long-Term Scaling

Long-term, you might want to:

Containerize for ECS (Fargate) with load balancers.

Store secrets in SSM Parameter Store or Secrets Manager.

Automate builds with CodePipeline or GitHub Actions.

-------------------------------------------------------

First thing I question is whether i want to manage postgres from within Terraform.  I would like to be able to deploy this to production and then tear it down without having to create and destroy a database every time.  I want the data to survive so it doesn't seem like the right thing to do to have it within Terraform

ChatGPT said:

You're absolutely right to raise that question ‚Äî and your instinct is correct.

‚úÖ Summary Answer:

You should not manage your production PostgreSQL database lifecycle directly with Terraform if:

  You want the data to persist between deployments.

  You want more control over how/when the DB is updated or destroyed.

  You want to avoid accidentally destroying production data due to a terraform destroy.

Instead, it‚Äôs better to create the database manually (or semi-manually) outside of Terraform and then reference it in your app‚Äôs configuration.

üß† Why This Makes Sense

Pros of Not Managing Postgres in Terraform:

Benefit	                      Explanation
Persistence	                  Terraform treats infrastructure as disposable; databases should not be.
Safety	                      Accidental terraform destroy won‚Äôt wipe your data.
Operational Flexibility	      You can snapshot, upgrade, and tune the DB outside Terraform.
Granular Access Control	      DB and application teams can work independently.

Terraform Can Still Help:
You can still:

  Create a security group for DB access.

  Output RDS hostname or credentials as variables.

  Create parameter store entries (e.g., AWS SSM) to hold connection strings securely.

But the RDS instance itself should probably be manually created via the AWS Console or a separate Terraform module with its own lifecycle (and never destroyed automatically).

üõ†Ô∏è What You Can Do Instead

Option 1: Create RDS Manually, Reference It

1 Go to AWS Console ‚Üí RDS ‚Üí Create Database.

    Engine: PostgreSQL

    Size: db.t3.micro (for low-cost)

    Storage: Enable auto-scaling

    Turn off "Delete protection" only if you're sure.

    Set initial database name, username, and password.

2 Record Endpoint, Port, Username, Password.

  Add those to:

    backend/.env.production

    Your docker-compose.production.yml as environment variables:

      environment:
        POSTGRES_HOST: mydb-instance.abcdefg1234.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com
        POSTGRES_PORT: 5432
        POSTGRES_DB: mydb
        POSTGRES_USER: myuser
        POSTGRES_PASSWORD: supersecure

4 üéØ Optionally store the credentials in AWS SSM Parameter Store or Secrets Manager for better security.

Option 2: Separate Terraform Module for DB (Advanced)

If you eventually want to track the RDS instance with Terraform, you can:

  Put it in a separate module.

  Mark it with lifecycle { prevent_destroy = true }

  Avoid running terraform destroy against that part of the config.

But for now, manual setup is perfectly fine and safer.


‚úÖ Recommended Action Plan

  Manually create your RDS database.

  Configure your app to use it, using .env.production.

  Keep Terraform focused on networking, EC2, ALB, etc.

  (Later) Automate database backups and credentials with AWS-native tools.


Would you like help creating:

  A secure .env.production template?

  A script to load those variables into EC2 via SSM or .env?

  A secure RDS creation guide (via Console)?
